Code for a pygame button problem

So I came across a question about pygame buttons in a subreddit and decided to propose a solution that I am now sharing here.

The idea was to create a button in pygame that prints "Hey" onto the screen when clicked.
As creating buttons in Pygame is a bit extensive, I decided to create a button class that inherits all necessary
properties for creating Pygame buttons a lot faster.
